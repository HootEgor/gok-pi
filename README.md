## Service to control battery discharging

The aim of this project is to develop a service that automates battery discharging control using the Sonnen controller's API. The service fulfills two main objectives:

1. **Automation**: It simplifies the process of battery management by automating various tasks, such as monitoring battery status, controlling charging and discharging based on set parameters, and more.

2. **Optimization**: It utilizes the power of automation and real-time data to optimize the battery usage and durability. This potentially leads to more efficient energy use, cost savings, and prolongs battery life.

## Project Purpose and Scope

With the increasing importance of sustainable energy, battery storage and management is a critical component of the power grid. This Sonnen Battery Controller turns Controller's API usage into a more automated and simplified task.

This service could be utilized in residential, commercial, or utility-scale settings where Sonnen battery systems are installed. Potential uses include renewable energy storage, backup power, load shifting, and more.

## Flexibility & Deployment

This service is designed with a versatile deployment nature. It can run on various platforms, hence making it adaptable to different use case scenarios:

- **Standalone Server**: The service can be installed and run on a standalone server in setups where higher computer power, storage, and network connectivity are required. Particularly useful in commercial or utility-scale deployments.

- **Low-power Devices like Raspberry Pi**: Our service is lightweight and does not require intensive computing resources. Therefore, it can be easily set up and run on low-power, cost-effective devices such as a Raspberry Pi. This could be a perfect solution for residential installations or small-scale deployments.

The ability to run on diverse platforms like a standalone server or a Raspberry Pi ensures that this service can cater to different needs, be it for a heavy-duty commercial setup or a small-scale residential use.

## Sonnen Controller's API

Sonnen's API provides a comprehensive set of controls and data for managing and monitoring a battery system. This includes functions for reading battery status, controlling battery charging and discharging, reading and setting battery parameters, and more.
