## Service to control battery discharging

This service is designed to control the discharging of battery systems through the seamless integration with the Sonnen API, a popular battery control interface.

## Project Purpose and Scope

With the increasing importance of sustainable energy, battery storage and management is a critical component of the power grid. This Sonnen Battery Controller turns Controller's API usage into a more automated and simplified task.

This service could be utilized in residential, commercial, or utility-scale settings where Sonnen battery systems are installed. Potential uses include renewable energy storage, backup power, load shifting, and more.

## Sonnen Controller's API

Sonnen's API provides a comprehensive set of controls and data for managing and monitoring a battery system. This includes functions for reading battery status, controlling battery charging and discharging, reading and setting battery parameters, and more.
